# RESTEasy testsuite

## Introduction
The aim of testsuite module is to provide unit and integration tests for Resteasy.
All newly added tests go into this module. 
The integration tests run with specified Wildfly server.

## Testsuite structure
- arquillian-utils - contains helper classes used often in tests like - help methods for creating the deployment, 
categories for tests, server setup task etc.
- integration-tests - contains tests to run in container (Wildfly)
- integration-tests-spring - tests for resteasy integration with spring
- unit-tests - standalone tests not running in container

## Guidance for new tests
* Keep structure of the tests [example](integration-tests/src/test/java/org/jboss/resteasy/test/resource/param/CookieInjectionTest.java).
* Document test class and all tests within test class see [Test Documentation](#Test Documentation). It will help others to understand.
* Provide RESTEASY jira number if possible, it will help to track the issue in the future.
* For integration tests avoid using concrete address like "http://localhost:8080". Tests don't need to be run always on the default hostname/port.
See example above.
* If you keep in mind above points, you will help us to keep Resteasy testsuite organized and stable.

### Dependencies
* Dependencies for testsuite are managed from single point ``../resteasy-dependencies-bom/pom.xml``
* Pom file above contains all dependencies versions managed via dependency management.
* Use the pom above to specify dependency version and in your pom in testsuite module use only:

```
<dependency>
      <groupId>group.id</groupId>
      <artifactId>arttifact.id</artifactId>
      <!-- If needed <scope>test</scope> -->
</dependency>
```

## Running testsuite module

### All tests
Run default tests (excluding the ones expected to fail) with the default container (it is automatically downloaded):
> mvn clean verify

Run default tests (excluding the ones expected to fail) with path to the container specified:
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME

### All tests including the failing ones
By default all tests annotated with ``@Category({ ExpectedFailing.class })``
are excluded. 

To run the testsuite with failing tests included for testing purposes:
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Denable.expected.failing -fn

### Single test
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dtest=NAME_OF_THE_TEST_CLASS -fn

### Speciality single test JsonBindingTest and JsonBindingAnnotationsJacksonTest
To run test JsonBindingTest requires the use of a speciality surefire syntax.
> mvn surefire:test@jsonb-test  -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dtest=JsonBindingTest -fn

"@jsonb-test" is the id of a surefile execution definition in the pom file.

Test JsonBindingAnnotationsJacksonTest is run with command
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dtest=JsonBindingAnnotationsJacksonTest -fn

### Custom resteasy version
Resteasy version for unit-tests and for client side of integration tests can be specified with ``-Dversion.resteasy.testsuite=RESTEASY_VERSION``

> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dversion.resteasy.testsuite=RESTEASY_VERSION

### Jax-rs 2.0 mode
By default integration tests run with jax-rs 2.1 implementation enabled on the server side.
To run jax-rs 2.0 compatible mode use:
> mvn clean verify -Djaxrs20

### IPv6 testing
Use ``ipv6`` property and specify IP address for EAP binding for IPv6 testing. Example:
 
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dnode=2620:52:0:2804:56ee:75ff:fe1d:44c3 -Dipv6

### Security manager
Run testsuite or test with the Wildfly with security manager enabled:

> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dsecurity.manager

### Remote server
Run testsuite or test connecting to a running server:

> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Darquillian.remote

Keep in mind that the remote server needs to be started with the option `-Dnode=127.0.0.1` or the binding IP in order for some tests to work properly.

### Test logs
Test logs are stored in ``/MODULE_NAME/target/surefire-reports/TEST_NAME-output.txt``

To redirect to standard output (console) use ``-Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile=false``.

> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Dmaven.test.redirectTestOutputToFile=false

### Set security subsystem for the tests (PicketBox/Elytron)
The testsuite can run in **two modes**, which differ by security subsystem configuration and by subsystem used in the tests,
which require security domain defined.

The tests which require security domain configuration are extending ``org.jboss.resteasy.setup.AbstractUsersRolesSecurityDomainSetup``
which implements ServerSetupTask.

#### Default (PicketBox) security configuration is used, Elytron is not enabled
Tests run with PicketBox security domain. This is the default.
  
#### Elytron security subsystems are enabled
Tests run with Elytron security domain. Activate this mode by:
> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Delytron

## Jacoco test coverage
You can generate Jacoco test coverage report with the following steps.

### Generate Jacoco test coverage data
Jacoco coverage data files are generated under target folder of the each testsuite module.

> mvn clean verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -Djacoco

### Generate Jacoco html report
After jacoco data files are generated you can generate jacoco html report.

You have option to provide jacoco report with the source files to see more detailed report:
```
mkdir $SOURCES
for i in $(find . | grep "src/main/java$"); do echo $i; cp -r $i/* $SOURCES/; done
```

Run following command to generate html report (property `sources.path` is optional):
> mvn verify -Dserver.home=PATH_TO_WIDLFLY_HOME -DskipTests -Djacoco.generate.report -Dsources.path=$SOURCES

## Test documentation
With each new test write appropriate javadoc documentation.

We keep test documentation for test cases (test classes) as follows:

```
/**
 * @tpChapter Main chapter name (see chapter structure below)
 * @tpSubChapter Sub-chapter name (see chapter structure below)
 * @tpTestCaseDetails Description of the test class, id of JIRA issue if applicable
 * @tpSince RESTEasy 3.x.x (in which version of resteasy was this test added)
 */
```

The test methods itself are annotated as follows:

```
/**
 * @tpTestDetails Description of what the test does
 * @tpSince RESTEasy 3.x.x (in which version of resteasy was this test added)
 */
```
